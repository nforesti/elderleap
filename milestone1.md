## Proposal Description:
### Target population: elderly users over the age of 65 in need of a phone. 
Our appâ€™s target user population are the elderly which is generally defined to those whom are retired and often have difficulty learning and adopting new technologies. None of our team members are part of that use population as we are all college students between the ages of 18-22 and not above the age of 65. 
### How can we help elderly Americans find electronic devices that fit their needs?
Our proposed project is creating a website that addresses the current challenges facing many elderly individuals today which is the difficulty in adopting and learning new technologies. In particular, our website helps elderly individuals find and choose the right technological devices to suit their needs such as finding a phones and tablets. Currently if an elderly individual were to decide to purchase a smartphone, there would be 1. Confusion over which smartphone to pick, and 2. Vulnerability at being exploited by the salespeople to choose the newest and most expensive option and not the one that suits their needs. Our website would help the user choose which phone or tablet to purchase depending on their needs which they would communicate by answering a few questions. If an elderly person wants a new phone or device, they will use our website, which will show all relevant and unbiased information to aid them in their decision. Hence, the elderly user will be empowered in the process and be less susceptible to scams related to buying devices. We also hope to provide a rating system (rating of XYZ device for and by other elderly people using the website).

### Sources of real-world data:
* Global Accessibility Reporting Initiative (GARIO) database that categorized various technological devices including phones, tablets, mobile apps, and connected wearables based on their ease of use appealing to hearing, vision, speech, dexterity, and cognition. We will use this website to find the names and information of devices that suit the needs of the user. https://www.gari.info/findphones-advanced.cfm
* GARIO database is a Mobile Device Description API with data on the Device Name, brand, technology, dimensions, weight, type, size, and other technical aspects or specifications of mobile phones. This API takes in the device name or brand and returns a lot of information about that device. We may have to cross reference this with the database. https://github.com/shakee93/fonoapi/blob/master/README.md


## Storyboard 1
This storyboard illustrates some of the elder abuse that occurs when elderly who understand little about technology are coerced into purchasing the most expensive new devices rather than cheaper devices more suited to their needs. An elderly man who has experienced this tries using our website and is empowered when he goes to the store and already knows what devices he needs in mind; hence, he is not able to fall into the scam of phone sellers.

## Storyboard 2
This storyboard illustrates how we envision the user flow and demonstrates a use case for an elder seeking to purchase a new tablet or phone and how Elderleap can help them find the right device for them. An elderly woman wants to easily be able to find a device that has large visual output and text size. The website helps her and her son find this.

## Prototype 1
This prototype utilizes a quiz selection interface to help the elderly find the right phone device to suit their needs. Through the questions (related to price, phone size, brand), the website will narrow down the options so that the the user will only have a few options that fit their needs. With a few options, the user can then go to the local phone store and try out the devices. There is also a rating and review feature (rated for and by elderly users). This interface provides two options. If a user already knows what type of device they want (and are more technologically-skilled) or wants to leave a rating, they can search for the device directly. Otherwise, they can be guided through the questionairre. Because there is a rating system, this is not meant for one-time use; we hope that users will come back, reference this, see their saved devices, and leave ratings.

## Prototype 2
This prototype utilizes a filtering interface to help elderly find the proper device (phone or tablet) for them. This will give users a lot more flexibility by allowing them to easily play around with different specifications. This interface also provides different information from prototype 1, such as Uses. Also, there is no login with this system, so the ratings and reviews are from a separate source, rather than made by fellow users. In general, this prototype is much simpler and meant for one-time use.
