# Milestone 2

## Background
After researching and prototyping our idea from Milestone 1, 
we decided to go in a different direction due to some implementation issues with our first prototoype. Our new proposal for a web app is a
communication tool for nonverbal children with autism. Our app would serve as a tool for our users to communicate by using an image-based text-to-speech interface. In addition, we are considering implementing features such as auto-complete, and possibly a "learning" feature to display a video demo of an ASL symbol corresponding to a given word. 

## Paper Prototype
Below is a paper prototype for A.C.T - "Assistive Communication Tool". It consists of a homepage with general information about the app and its features, a login page, and the main interface of the web-app containing a grid of images that the user can click on to trigger a text-to-speech function associated with the image. Finally, there is an About Me page with important information about the user for caregivers to access - such as allergies, medications, and emergency contact numbers.

## Wireframes

Below are wireframes for the main pages of the application.

## Screenshots of UI Webpages
Our main webpages differ from our original paper prototypes in Milestone 1 due to a change in the central project idea.
The screenshots below are based on the paper prototype and wireframes presented in this milestone. We implemented the home page,
the main interface of the app containing a grid of categories, which links to the next logical page containing subcategories after the user has clicked on a category.
