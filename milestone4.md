# Milestone 4

## Screenshots of UI Webpages

### (1) Home Page
For our home page, we simplified the features displayed in the three center boxes. Instead of describing each functionality in detail, 
we identified the key highlights of our app and wrote a one sentence description. We removed the ASL feature since we were not able to get access to the youtube videos and incorporate them into our app.

### (2) Dashboard - Displays categories
We added a title and description to this page to orient the user to what actions they can do on this page. We also changed the configuration of the yellow boxes to have a consistent height and width so that one category doesn't stand out more than another.

### Display subcategories
The main feature we added to this page is a list of suggested words related to each category displayed at the bottom of the page. This allows for a more informative interaction than simple clicking on images.
