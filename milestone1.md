## Idea:
### Target population: elderly users over the age of 60 in need of a phone. 
### How can we help elderly Americans find electronic devices that fit their needs?
Our proposed project is creating a website that addresses the current challenges facing many elderly individuals today which is the difficulty in adopting and learning new technologies. In particular, our website helps elderly individuals find and choose the right technological devices to suit their needs such as finding a phones and tablets. Currently if an elderly individual were to decide to purchase a smartphone, there would be 1. Confusion over which smartphone to pick, and 2. Vulnerability at being exploited by the salespeople to choose the newest and most expensive option and not the one that suits their needs. Our website would help the user choose which phone or tablet to purchase depending on their needs which they would communicate by answering a few questions. If an elderly person wants a new phone or device, they will use our website, which will show all relevant and unbiased information to aid them in their decision. Hence, the elderly user will be empowered in the process and be less susceptible to scams related to buying devices. We also hope to provide a rating system (rating of XYZ device for and by other elderly people using the website).

### Sources of real-world data:
* Global Accessibility Reporting Initiative (GARIO) database that categorized various technological devices including phones, tablets, mobile apps, and connected wearables based on their ease of use appealing to hearing, vision, speech, dexterity, and cognition. We will use this website to find the names and information of devices that suit the needs of the user. https://www.gari.info/findphones-advanced.cfm
* GARIO database is a Mobile Device Description API with data on the Device Name, brand, technology, dimensions, weight, type, size, and other technical aspects or specifications of mobile phones. This API takes in the device name or brand and returns a lot of information about that device. We may have to cross reference this with the database. https://github.com/shakee93/fonoapi/blob/master/README.md
