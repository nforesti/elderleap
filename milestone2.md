# Milestone 2

## Background
After researching and prototyping our idea from Milestone 1, 
we decided to go in a different direction due to some implementation issues with our first prototoype. Our new target users are 
nonverbal children with autism, and our app would serve as a tool to help them communicate using an image-based interface. 

## Paper Prototype

## Wireframes

## Screenshots of UI Webpages
Our main webpages differ from our paper prototypes in Milestone 1 due to a change in the central project idea.
The screenshots below are based on our paper prototype and wireframes for our new project proposal.
