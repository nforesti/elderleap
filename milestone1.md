## Idea:
### How can we help elderly Americans find electronic devices that fit their needs?
### Target population: elderly users over the age of 60 in need of a phone or tablet. *None of our team members are over the age of 60.*
We aim to create a website that will guide elderly users towards finding a device (phone or tablet) that fits them. We have heard of multiple accounts in which elderly users are scammed into buying devices that they do not understand or need. Other users have been convinced by their local phone carriers to buy the newest most expensive iPhone, when really they just need a way to call their children. If an elderly person wants a new phone or device, they will use our website, which will show all relevant and unbiased information to aid them in their decision. Hence, the elderly user will be empowered in the process and be less susceptible to scams related to buying devices. We also hope to provide a rating system (rating of XYZ device for and by other elderly people using the website).
### Sources of real-world data:
* Database: https://www.gari.info/findphones-advanced.cfm
This database contains all accessibility information related to any phone. We will pull most accessibility information from this database.
* API: https://github.com/shakee93/fonoapi/blob/master/README.md
This API takes in the device name or brand and returns a lot of information about that device. We may have to cross reference this with the database.
