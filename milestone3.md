# Milestone 3

## Screenshots of UI Webpages
Our main webpages differ from our original paper prototypes in Milestone 1 due to a change in the central project idea.
The screenshots below are based on the paper prototype and wireframes presented in this milestone. We implemented the home page,
the main interface of the app containing a grid of categories, which links to the next logical page containing subcategories after the user has clicked on a category.
