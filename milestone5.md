## Written Storyboard

Case 1: One target user is a nonverbal child who does not know how to type. The setting mignt be at their home, in the morning. They are hungry and want to ask for cereal for breakfast. They sit at the dining table, take out their tablet device and access the ACT app, which has been previously set up by a parent or caregiver. When a parent or sibling is present, the child clicks on the "food" category, which displays an array of food items they can click on. Then they click on the image for "cereal", which plays the word "cereal" out loud. The parent or sibling sees the child interacting with the device and clicking on "cereal", or they might just hear the word. They go to the cabinet and get the cereal box and pour the child a bowl. 

Case 2: Another target user is a nonverbal child who does know how to type. The setting might be at school, where the child wants to introduce themselves to a classmate or teacher. They take out their tablet device and open up the ACT app, then navigate to the "Keyboard" page. They type "hi, my name is Ben", and then click on a button to trigger a text-to-speech readout of what they wrote. The message "hi, my name is Ben", is vocalized. They click "save" to save the phrase they typed so they can re-use it again at a later time. The teacher or classmate might respond back, "Hi Ben, nice to meet you!", completing the interaction.
