# Milestone 3

## Screenshots of UI Webpages

### (1) Home Page
We have taken out login functionality. Hence, the index page buttons no longer lead the user to the login page. We also changed the UI of the homepage so that each of the 3 sections are clickable. The layout and style of the page and navigation has also been improved for usability.

### (2) Dashboard - Displays categories
We have added search functionality. The search is not hooked up to the actual database but instead uses a small subset of json. This utilizes React. We also have implemented the images api, so there are now images and real general categories that are in the Firebase database. There also is no longer a profile in the navigation. Lastly, we changed the layout of the categories. They now are a more responsive grid that fit together like a collage.

### Display subcategories
There is also search functionality on this page. This is also now a more responsive grid and pulling in real data and images from Pexels API and Firebase. Lastly, the navigation disappears when in the subcategories and is replaced by browse.

This was a blank page before. There is now a responsive text box that changes size depending on the amount of text. Also, when the user clicks the button, the text is read out loud.
